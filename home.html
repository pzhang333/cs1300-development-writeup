        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>
          React is one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries today.
          To get more comfortable using the React framework and writing React
          components, I was given the task to create a list interface for a website
          using React and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, I wanted my interface to support the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filtering by Categories</li>
          <li>Sorting by Categories</li>
          <li>Aggregating Selected Items</li>
          <li>Displaying Items and Associated Data</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container pt-3 pb-2">
      <h2>Creating the Application:</h2>
      <p>
        The first goal of my website was to create an application where users could
        explore League of Legends characters and decide which ones to buy. 
        League of Legends is a popular online game that has (as of November 2020)
        152 unique characters. With so many choices, it can be difficult for 
        new players to decide what characters they might want to buy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In an attempt to solve this problem, my application provides convenient 
        filtering and sorting tools so a new user can easily find a champion 
        they are looking for, and provides a cart feature so that the user can
        see the total cost of all the characters they wish to purchase. Filters
        and sorting can be combined in any number of ways so users have the 
        freedom to filter to the granularity that they require.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other main goal was to create a React application with a clean and
        intuitive architecture that future developers would also be able to use.
        Therefore, while writing the code for my web app, I tried to follow 
        best practices, such as separating distinct functionality into distinct
        React components and commenting my code as necessary.

        <h2>Usability Principles:</h2>
        <p>
          Although the primary goal of this project was more development focused
          and less design focused, I still tried to follow best design principles
          while creating my application.
        </p>
        <h3>Visual Consistency</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In character cards, the button is left left-aligned with the text.</li>
          <li>Class and Role Icons use the same, consistent gold color scheme.</li>
          <li>
            All buttons are aligned to the bottom of each character card.
            This also makes it easy to quickly add multiple characters to the cart.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I chose a dark themed color palette with sufficient contrast.</li>
          <li>I also chose a bright blue as my primary color to highlight certain interface elements like buttons.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The most important content, the character cards, are in the center of the page.</li>
          <li>
            The filter/sort menu and the cart are large and placed at the sides of the page.
            Their large size makes them easy to navigate to from anywhere on the page
            (Fitts's Law).
          </li>
          <li>The page is responsive and the grid adapts to the size of the viewport.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I chose to use a native font stack for my application.</li>
          <li>
            I use different text sizes to highlight importance. Larger text
            is more important in my app.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
        <p>
          Developing a website using React and JavaScript instead of basic
          HTML/CSS is definitely a much different experience. In general,
          I felt that using React was a more "traditional" programming experience.
          Using React components allowed me to create reusable pieces of code
          similar to object-oriented programming. If I was using only HTML and
          CSS, I would have been forced to simply copy and paste my code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although developing a React application definitely has a learning curve,
          as you need to learn React specific syntax and rules, I think the
          overall development experience with React is much more enjoyable that
          using the typical HTML and CSS combination. HTML/CSS/JavaScript are good
          for basic websites, but implementing more advanced features that could be
          reused such as a list interface with filtering and sorting would be much
          more difficult than doing the same using React.
